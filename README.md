# LLM Fine-tune Project

This project contains files and artifacts for fine-tuning a language model, likely based on TinyLlama or a similar architecture. The workspace includes model weights, configuration files, training states, and a Jupyter notebook for running and documenting the fine-tuning process.

## Project Structure

- `tinyllama-finetune.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for running and documenting the fine-tuning process.
- `adapter_config.json`, `adapter_model.safetensors`: Adapter configuration and weights for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA, adapters).
- `optimizer.pt`, `scheduler.pt`, `scaler.pt`, `rng_state.pth`: Training state files for optimizer, scheduler, mixed-precision scaler, and random number generator.
- `special_tokens_map.json`, `tokenizer_config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `tokenizer.model`: Tokenizer files and configuration.
- `chat_template.jinja`: Jinja template for chat formatting or prompt construction.
- `trainer_state.json`, `training_args.bin`: Trainer state and arguments used for fine-tuning.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Notebook**: Use `tinyllama-finetune.ipynb` to review or continue the fine-tuning process.
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python packages installed (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`, `datasets`).
3. **Model Artifacts**: The model and adapter weights are saved in the workspace and can be loaded for inference or further training.

## Usage

- Run or modify the notebook to fine-tune, evaluate, or use the model.
- Use the configuration and state files to resume training or reproduce results.

## Notes

- This project assumes familiarity with Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch.
- For custom chat templates or prompt engineering, edit `chat_template.jinja`.
